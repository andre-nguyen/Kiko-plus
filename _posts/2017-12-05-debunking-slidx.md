It all started when I came across this article from the *Les Affaires* titled "[*Trois jeunes québécoises parmi les géants de l'industrie du drone*](http://www.lesaffaires.com/secteurs-d-activite/aeronautique-et-aerospatiale/ces-trois-start-ups-quebecoises-vont-revolutionner-lindustrie-du-drone/595566)" (Three young Quebecers among the giants of the drone industry) published in may of 2017. Now first of all, I have immense respect for ARA Robotique but I wouldn't call them a giant of the industry. They are still in their infancy but I would say it looks like they are on track to doing great things. Pascal and the rest of his team are extremely dedicated and hard workers. Laflamme Aéro is another company that I know for a fact is still in its beginnings, last I heard was that they were still bench testing their tandem helicopter. However, they are backed by a lot of money from the Consortium for Aerospace Research and Innovation in Canada and I know of one student here at Polytechnique Montreal working on a flight controller for them.

What caught my attention was the last company mentioned in the article named SlidX, claiming to have sunk $180 000 into the project to create a VTOL cargo drone. Interested, I decided to look a bit more into the company.
