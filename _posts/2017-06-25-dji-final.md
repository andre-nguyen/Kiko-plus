Note: I am now writing thing almost a year later so some of the finer details
have been lost or are a bit fuzzy.

One of the nice things about having the competition in the state of New York
was that we had a logistical advantage in that we just needed to drive down in a few
hours to get to the state of New York. By renting a van, we could also bring all
the equipment we needed including a power supply, a computer screen and a desktop.
One of the guys from Autero screamed "A DESKTOP?!" when he saw us.

As I usually do when I go to competitions, we arrived a day early to attempt to
scope out the site and get a better understanding of what was happening.
Unfortunately for us, the airport is a legitimate airport with security and all
and we couldn't actually go in to inspect the site. The DJI employees were pretty
nice to us and actually gave us some spare parts we needed to fix our GPS mast.
You could feel they really wanted everyone to succeed.

Finally meeting all the teams was awkward at first, it was tough to gauge what
level they were at without seeing their system in action.

During prep time I had a chance of speaking to Robert Schlub Vice president of R&D
at DJI, who one of the people running the competition. Little did I know that he
used to be director of antenna design at Apple, so I looked pretty ridiculous
coming in with my huge Ubiquity antenna.
