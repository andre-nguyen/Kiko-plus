My name is Andre Phu-Van Nguyen and I'm an M.Sc.A. student at Polytechnique 
Montreal part of the Mobile Robotics and Autonomous Systems Laboratory under
professors [Jerome Le Ny](http://www.professeurs.polymtl.ca/jerome.le-ny/) 
and [David Saussie](http://www.polymtl.ca/recherche/rc/en/professeurs/details.php?NoProf=513).

My research interests focus on aerial robotics with an emphasis on computer 
vision and path planning. Since the beginning of my bachelor's diploma in
computer engineering, I have been involved in multiple projects including:

* The 6th iteration of the [Esteban Solar Car](http://esteban.polymtl.ca) team 
where I worked on telemetry systems for remote car monitoring. I was also webmaster
and main photographer for a while. In 2012 we participated in the 
[American Solar Challenge](http://americansolarchallenge.org/the-competition/ascfsgp-2012/) raycing across
the United-States from Rochester, NY to St. Paul, MN over 8 days. We also participated
in the [Formula Sun Grand Prix](http://americansolarchallenge.org/the-competition/ascfsgp-2012/)
as it is a mandatory event to qualify for the ASC.

* In 2013 I started the [Elikos](http://elikos.polymtl.ca) autonomous quadrotor
team where I was team director leading us to win 1st place twice at the American
Venue of the [International Aerial Robotics Competition](http://aerialroboticscompetition.org/)
in the summers of 2014 and 2015.
In addition to my responsibilities in terms of team financing and project 
management, in our first year I worked on getting an optical flow based quadrotor
flying using offboard commands (recall that in 2013 px4's offboard control did 
not yet exist). In our second year we were able to demonstrate ground robot 
tracking using blob detection, with a new quadrotor equipped for omnidirectional
sensing. For these accomplishments, in 2014 I was given the award of "Directeur de 
Société Technique de l'année" (best technical club director) by the Association
des Étudiants de Polytechnique.

* In 2016 I was team captain of a group of 4 graduate students participating in
the [DJI Developper Challenge](https://developer.dji.com/news/2016-dji-developer-challenge-10-teams-enter-final-round/) 
under the name SaveApril (later renamed MRASL) . 
We were tasked to fufill a search and rescue
mission consisting of taking off of a moving vehicle, searching for AprilTags
in a cluttered environment and coming back and landing on a moving vehicle. Out
of 130 initial proposals we made it to the last selection rounds out of 10 teams
to be invited to Griffis International airport for field trials. Although we did
not win, we were still able to publish our moving landing method going at velocity
of 50 km/h, the fastest landing of a quadrotor on a moving platform as of yet.
